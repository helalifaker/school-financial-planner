## Remaining Step: GitHub Push

**Status:** 7 commits ready to push  
**Blocking Issue:** GitHub authentication required

### Solution Options

#### Option A: Use Deploy Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner
./deploy.sh
```
The script will prompt for your GitHub Personal Access Token and handle the push.

#### Option B: Manual Push with Token
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner

# Replace <YOUR_TOKEN> with your GitHub Personal Access Token
git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/helalifaker/school-financial-planner.git
git push origin main

# Restore URL (for security)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/helalifaker/school-financial-planner.git
```

#### Option C: Switch to SSH
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:helalifaker/school-financial-planner.git
git push origin main
```

## Automatic Vercel Deployment

Once pushed to GitHub:
1. Vercel will automatically detect the new commits
2. Build will start (typically 2-3 minutes)
3. New version will be live at: https://school-financial-planner-rpfb-e4mqm9vr1-faker-helalis-projects.vercel.app

## Testing Checklist

After Vercel deployment completes, test the following:

### Property Metadata
- [ ] Create new version
- [ ] Enter land size (e.g., "5,000 sqm")
- [ ] Enter building size (e.g., "3,500 sqm")
- [ ] Enter comments (e.g., "Prime location near metro")
- [ ] Submit and verify metadata saves
- [ ] Check version list shows property info
- [ ] Check version detail shows full property information

### French/IB Split
- [ ] Verify separate French and IB student enrollment fields (2025-2027)
- [ ] Check dual tuition rates with shared growth parameters
- [ ] Confirm growth frequency dropdown shows 1-5 years
- [ ] Test long-term section has same structure
- [ ] Run model and verify calculations work correctly

### Recurring CAPEX
- [ ] Add IT & Digital Learning configuration
  - Recurrence: 2 years
  - Depreciation: 2 years
  - Verify live preview shows entries every 2 years
- [ ] Add Buildings & Facilities configuration
  - Recurrence: 2 years
  - Depreciation: 10 years
  - Verify correct schedule generation
- [ ] Add Transportation configuration
  - Recurrence: 4 years
  - Depreciation: 2 years
  - Verify entries appear every 4 years
- [ ] Check combined preview shows all entries sorted by year
- [ ] Run model and verify CAPEX appears in financial statements

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Create complete version with all features
- [ ] Verify Balance Sheet shows PPE calculations
- [ ] Check Cash Flow shows CAPEX investments
- [ ] Confirm P&L shows depreciation
- [ ] Test version comparison functionality
- [ ] Export reports and verify data accuracy

## Documentation

All documentation is in the repository root:
- `DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `ASSUMPTIONS-PAGE-FIXES.md` - French/IB implementation details
- `RECURRING-CAPEX-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete CAPEX system guide (407 lines, updated)
- `RECURRING-CAPEX-QUICK-START.md` - User-friendly reference (219 lines, updated)
- `CAPEX-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - OCR data fix documentation (154 lines)
- `PROPERTY-METADATA-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Metadata technical guide (221 lines)
- `PROPERTY-METADATA-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment steps (208 lines)
- `deploy.sh` - Interactive deployment script

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `app/assumptions/page.tsx` - All three features implemented
- `app/versions/page.tsx` - Property metadata display in list
- `app/versions/[id]/page.tsx` - Property metadata in detail view
- `supabase/functions/run-model/index.ts` - Property metadata support

### Database Schema
No schema changes required - property metadata uses existing `version.metadata` JSON field

### Backward Compatibility
All features are backward compatible:
- Existing versions work without property metadata
- Old CAPEX entries continue to function
- French/IB split uses default values if not specified

## What Changed in Latest Fix

### OCR Data Correction (Commits 6a41dfd, fb8c016)

**Problem:** Original recurring CAPEX implementation used corrupted OCR data with wrong recurrence and depreciation periods.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated CAPEX_CATEGORIES constant with corrected values
- Fixed initial state to use proper asset types
- Updated all documentation with accurate examples
- Verified auto-generation logic works with corrected data

**Impact:** Users who created versions with recurring CAPEX before this fix should review their configurations. The system will continue to work, but the defaults have changed to more accurate lifecycle parameters.

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for build errors
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Check Supabase edge function logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/unwehmjzzyghaslunkkl/logs/edge-functions
4. Review comprehensive documentation files

## Next Action

**Execute one of the GitHub push options above to deploy to production.**

---

**Summary:** All development complete. Edge function deployed. Only GitHub push remains before production testing.
