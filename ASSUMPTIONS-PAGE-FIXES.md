# Assumptions Page Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Changes Summary

All user-requested fixes have been successfully implemented and committed to the repository.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Student Enrollment - French/IB Split
**Before:** Single student count per year
**After:** Separate fields for French and IB students

**Near-Term (2025-2027):**
- 2025 French Students: 1,394
- 2025 IB Students: 348
- 2026 French Students: 1,440
- 2026 IB Students: 360
- 2027 French Students: 1,480
- 2027 IB Students: 370

**Long-Term (2028-2052):**
- Year 1 (2028) French: 70 | IB: 30
- Year 2 (2029) French: 140 | IB: 60
- Year 3 (2030) French: 210 | IB: 90
- Year 4 (2031) French: 280 | IB: 120
- Year 5+ (2032-2052) French: 350 | IB: 150

### 2. Tuition Structure - Dual Rates
**Before:** Single tuition rate
**After:** Separate French and IB rates with shared growth parameters

**Near-Term:**
- French Tuition per Student: 33,213 SAR
- IB Tuition per Student: 44,284 SAR
- Annual Growth Rate: 5.00% (applies to both)
- Growth Frequency: Dropdown with 1-5 year options (applies to both)

**Long-Term:**
- French Tuition per Student: 45,000 SAR
- IB Tuition per Student: 60,000 SAR
- Annual Growth Rate: 5.00% (applies to both)
- Growth Frequency: Dropdown with 1-5 year options (applies to both)

### 3. Growth Frequency Dropdown - Extended Options
**Before:** Only 3 options (Every 1, 2, 3 years)
**After:** 5 options:
- Every 1 year
- Every 2 years
- Every 3 years
- Every 4 years
- Every 5 years

Applied to:
- Tuition growth frequency (near-term)
- Rent growth frequency (near-term)
- Tuition growth frequency (long-term)
- Rent growth frequency (long-term)

### 4. Rent Model - Fixed Conditional Fields
**Before:** Long-term "Fixed Plus Inflation" mode didn't show input fields
**After:** Proper conditional rendering in both sections

**Near-Term Section:**
- Rent Mode: Dropdown (Fixed Plus Inflation / Percentage of Revenue)
- If Fixed Plus Inflation:
  - Base Rent (SAR): 7,631,145
  - Inflation Rate (%): 3.00
- If Percentage of Revenue:
  - Rent as % of Revenue (%): 12.00
- Growth Frequency (years): Dropdown (1-5 years)

**Long-Term Section:**
- Rent Mode: Dropdown (Fixed Plus Inflation / Percentage of Revenue)
- If Fixed Plus Inflation:
  - Base Rent (SAR): 8,000,000
  - Inflation Rate (%): 3.00
- If Percentage of Revenue:
  - Rent as % of Revenue (%): 12.00
- Growth Frequency (years): Dropdown (1-5 years)

### 5. Backend Data Structure Updates
The calculation logic has been updated to properly handle:
- French/IB student separation
- Dual tuition rates with weighted averages
- Growth frequency application (every N years instead of annually)
- Rent growth frequency for inflation-based models

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `app/assumptions/page.tsx` (1 file, 294 insertions, 78 deletions)

### State Variables Added
**Near-Term:**
- `students2025French`, `students2025IB`
- `students2026French`, `students2026IB`
- `students2027French`, `students2027IB`
- `tuitionFrench`, `tuitionIB`
- `rentGrowthFrequency`

**Long-Term:**
- `year1_2028French`, `year1_2028IB`
- `year2_2029French`, `year2_2029IB`
- `year3_2030French`, `year3_2030IB`
- `year4_2031French`, `year4_2031IB`
- `year5PlusFrench`, `year5PlusIB`
- `longTermTuitionFrench`, `longTermTuitionIB`
- `longTermBaseRent`, `longTermInflationRate`
- `longTermRentGrowthFreq`

### Calculation Logic Updates
1. **Student totals:** `total = french + ib`
2. **Weighted tuition average:** `avg = (frenchTuition * frenchStudents + ibTuition * ibStudents) / totalStudents`
3. **Growth application:** Only applied every N years based on frequency dropdown
4. **Rent inflation:** Applied according to growth frequency setting

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Manual Push & Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd school-financial-planner

# Check commit status
git log --oneline -5

# Push to GitHub (will prompt for credentials)
git push origin main

# Deploy automatically via Vercel (connected to GitHub)
# Or manually via Vercel CLI:
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Direct Vercel Deployment
```bash
cd school-financial-planner
vercel --prod
```

## Testing Checklist

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. Wait for automatic Vercel deployment (if connected)
3. Test the live application using the checklist above
4. Verify all calculations work correctly with new data structure
