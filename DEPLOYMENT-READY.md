## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

This is the fastest and easiest deployment method for Next.js applications.

#### A. Deploy via Vercel CLI (if you have access):
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### B. Deploy via GitHub + Vercel (Original Setup):
Since your repository is already at `github.com/helalifaker/school-financial-planner`:

1. **Push latest changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/school-financial-planner
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add financial enhancements: others expenses, historical data, 30-year planning"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-deploy** (if connected):
   - Vercel should automatically detect the push and deploy
   - Check your Vercel dashboard at https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Deployment typically completes in 2-3 minutes

3. **If not connected**, import from Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import `github.com/helalifaker/school-financial-planner`
   - Environment variables will auto-populate from `.env.local`
   - Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Other Platforms

**Netlify:**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
```

**Railway, Render, or Fly.io:**
These platforms all support Next.js SSR deployments with similar one-click import from GitHub.

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your deployment platform:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://unwehmjzzyghaslunkkl.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
```

## Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, test these key features:
1. Create a new financial model version
2. Verify the "Others Expenses (%)" field in assumptions
3. Check that financial statements show 2023-2024 historical data
4. Confirm planning horizon extends to 2052 (30 years)
5. Test all tabs: Overview, P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow

## Local Testing

To test locally before deploying:
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner
export PATH=/tmp/node-v20.18.0-linux-x64/bin:$PATH
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Current Build Location

The production build is located at:
- `/workspace/school-financial-planner/.next/` (built with Next.js 16.0.1)
- Node.js version: 20.18.0
- Build time: ~12 seconds
- All TypeScript checks passed

## Notes

- The application uses client-side rendering with Supabase for data
- Dynamic route `/versions/[id]` requires server-side rendering
- All Supabase edge functions are already deployed and operational
- No build errors or warnings
