## If You Encounter Issues

Common issues and solutions:

**Issue:** Reports page shows "Version not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you've created at least one model first

**Issue:** Can't delete models
**Solution:** Check if your user role is "admin" in the database

**Issue:** Balance Sheet/Cash Flow tabs are empty
**Solution:** The model might have been created before the update. Create a new model to see the data.

**Issue:** Compare page still shows 404
**Solution:** Make sure you've deployed the latest code from GitHub
