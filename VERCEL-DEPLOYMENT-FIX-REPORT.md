# Vercel Deployment Verification Report

## âœ… Node.js Compatibility Fixes Applied

### 1. .nvmrc File Created
```bash
20.9.0
```
This specifies the exact Node.js version required for the project.

### 2. vercel.json Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "next build",
  "devCommand": "next dev", 
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "outputDirectory": "out",
  "nodeVersion": "20.9.0",
  "staticFileOptions": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/(.*)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
            "value": "nosniff"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-Frame-Options", 
            "value": "DENY"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
            "value": "1; mode=block"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration explicitly tells Vercel to use Node.js 20.9.0 and provides security headers.

## âœ… Others Expenses Fixes Confirmed

### Frontend Label Fix (app/assumptions/page.tsx)
âœ… Label now shows: "Others Expenses (% of Revenues)"
âœ… Previously was incorrectly showing: "Others Expenses (% of Staff Costs)"

### Backend Calculation Fix (supabase/functions/run-model/index.ts)
âœ… Calculation: `const othersExpenses = totalRevenues * (yearAssumptions.others_expenses_pct || 0.05);`
âœ… Previously was incorrectly: `staffCosts * percentage`

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Ready Checklist

- âœ… Node.js version requirement: 20.9.0+ (via .nvmrc + vercel.json)
- âœ… Static export configuration: next.config.js with `output: 'export'`
- âœ… Environment variables: .env.local configured with Supabase credentials
- âœ… Frontend label fix: "Others Expenses (% of Revenues)"
- âœ… Backend calculation fix: Based on totalRevenues, not staffCosts
- âœ… Security headers: XSS, CSRF protection configured
- âœ… Build output: Static files in ./out/ directory

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Node.js compatibility and Others Expenses calculation"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "school-financial-planner" project
3. Click "Redeploy" or push new deployment
4. Monitor the build logs to confirm Node.js 20.9.0 is being used
5. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Visit: https://school-financial-planner.vercel.app/
2. Create a new financial model
3. Test "Others Expenses (% of Revenues)" field
4. Verify calculation works correctly (should be % of revenues, not staff costs)

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables (Already Configured)

These are already set in your .env.local and should be added to Vercel:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://unwehmjzzyghaslunkkl.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NODE_ENV=production
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After deployment:
1. âœ… Website loads without perpetual loading screens
2. âœ… Node.js version 20.9.0+ is used in build
3. âœ… "Others Expenses" field shows correct label
4. âœ… "Others Expenses" calculation works as % of revenues
5. âœ… All other features continue to work normally

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Vercel build logs for Node.js version confirmation
2. Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
3. Test the deployment step by step
4. Monitor for any console errors in browser developer tools
