## Deployment Summary

### Successfully Deployed Features
The enhanced school financial planner application has been deployed and is fully functional with the following improvements:

### Enhancement Status

#### 1. Others Expenses Field - ✅ FULLY WORKING
- **Feature**: New "Others Expenses (% of Staff Costs)" input field
- **Location**: Assumptions page, Cost Structure section
- **Status**: Successfully implemented and functional
- **Verification**: Field is visible, accepts input, value saved correctly

#### 2. 30-Year Planning Horizon - ✅ FULLY WORKING
- **Feature**: Extended planning period from 2023 to 2052
- **Status**: Successfully implemented across all financial statements
- **Verification**: All statement banners show "2023-2052" range, strategic planning sections reference 30-year model

#### 3. Historical Data 2023-2024 - ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Feature**: Historical financial data for years 2023-2024
- **Status**: UI updated but data not fully displayed
- **Current State**: 
  - Banner text references "2 years of historical data (2023-2024)"
  - Financial statement tables show only 2025+ data
  - Historical year columns (2023, 2024) are not present in P&L, Balance Sheet, or Cash Flow
- **Recommendation**: Further development needed to display actual 2023-2024 data columns

### Technical Implementation

**Deployment Method**:
1. Converted Next.js app from SSR to static export
2. Refactored dynamic route `/versions/[id]` to `/version-detail?id=xxx`
3. Added Suspense boundary for client-side routing
4. Built 11 static pages successfully
5. Deployed to space.minimax.io platform

**Build Configuration**:
- Next.js 16.0.1 with Turbopack
- Node.js 20.18.0
- Static export mode
- All pages pre-rendered

### Testing Results

**Comprehensive testing performed on live deployment:**

✅ **Authentication**: Login/logout working correctly
✅ **Navigation**: All pages accessible (Dashboard, Assumptions, Versions, Compare, Reports)
✅ **Model Creation**: Can create new financial models via Assumptions page
✅ **Version Management**: Can view and manage multiple model versions
✅ **Financial Statements**: P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow tabs all functional
✅ **Data Persistence**: Models save to Supabase successfully
✅ **No Console Errors**: Clean execution without JavaScript errors

### Application Structure

**Deployed Pages**:
- `/` - Homepage (redirects to dashboard/login)
- `/login` - Authentication
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with recent versions
- `/assumptions` - Create new financial models
- `/versions` - List all model versions
- `/version-detail` - Individual version details (with tabs)
- `/compare` - Compare multiple scenarios
- `/reports` - Generate reports

### Backend Integration

**Supabase Services** (Already deployed and working):

- Edge Functions: 
  - `run-model` - Calculate 30-year financial projections
  - `get-version` - Retrieve version data
- Authentication: Email/password auth
- Storage: Configured and operational

### Next Steps

To fully complete the historical data enhancement:
1. Update financial calculation logic to generate 2023-2024 historical data
2. Modify financial statement display components to show 2023-2024 columns
3. Ensure data flows from assumptions through to all statement views
