# Property Metadata Fields - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Added property information fields to the version management system to support evaluation of potential long-term lease partnerships and profit-sharing opportunities for new school buildings.

## Implementation Summary

### New Fields Added

**1. Land Size**
- Input field for land size with units
- Example: "2,500 m²"
- Displayed in version list and detail views

**2. Building Size**
- Input field for building size with units
- Example: "8,000 m²"
- Displayed in version list and detail views

**3. Property Comments**
- Textarea for detailed property information
- Examples: Location details, partnership terms, lease conditions
- Displayed in version list (truncated) and detail views (full)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage

Fields are stored in the `version.metadata` JSON field:
```typescript
metadata: {
  land_size: string,
  building_size: string,
  comments: string
}
```

### Frontend Changes

**1. Assumptions Page (Version Creation)**
- Added 3 state variables: `landSize`, `buildingSize`, `propertyComments`
- Created "Property Information" section in Version Setup
- Fields included in `handleRunModel` when creating version

**2. Version List Page**
- Displays land size and building size if available
- Shows truncated comments (2 lines max)
- Compact display format

**3. Version Detail Page**
- Full "Property Information" section in overview tab
- Complete display of all metadata fields
- Responsive grid layout

### Backend Changes

**run-model Edge Function**
- Updated to accept `propertyMetadata` parameter
- Stores metadata in version record
- No impact on financial calculations (metadata only)

## User Workflow

### Creating a Version with Property Information

1. Go to Assumptions page
2. Fill in Version Setup fields (name, type, school name)
3. Complete Property Information section:
   - Enter land size (e.g., "2,500 m²")
   - Enter building size (e.g., "8,000 m²")
   - Add comments about location, partnership terms, etc.
4. Configure financial assumptions as normal
5. Click "Run Model"

### Viewing Property Information

**Version List:**
- Property info displayed on each version card
- Quick overview of land and building sizes
- Truncated comments preview

**Version Detail:**
- Full property information in overview tab
- Complete comments displayed
- Easy comparison between scenarios

## Use Cases

### 1. Location Comparison
Compare different potential school locations by their property characteristics:
```
Version: Downtown Location
Land: 2,500 m²
Building: 8,000 m²
Comments: Prime location, high land cost but excellent demographics

Version: Suburban Location
Land: 5,000 m²
Building: 10,000 m²
Comments: Lower costs, room for expansion, partnership opportunity
```

### 2. Partnership Evaluation
Document partnership terms for each location:
```
Comments: "Long-term lease option with profit-sharing at 30/70 split. 
Landlord covers building maintenance. 15-year initial term with 
renewal options."
```

### 3. Financial Planning
Link property characteristics to financial assumptions:
```
Comments: "Larger building allows for 2,000 students vs. 1,500. 
CAPEX requirements lower due to landlord covering facility upgrades."
```

## Files Modified

1. **app/assumptions/page.tsx**
   - Added property metadata state variables
   - Created Property Information UI section
   - Updated handleRunModel to include metadata

2. **supabase/functions/run-model/index.ts**
   - Accepts propertyMetadata parameter
   - Stores in version.metadata field

3. **app/versions/page.tsx**
   - Displays property information in version cards
   - Compact format with truncated comments

4. **app/versions/[id]/page.tsx**
   - Full Property Information section in overview
   - Complete display of all metadata fields

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Edge Function
The run-model edge function needs to be redeployed with the metadata changes:
```bash
# Deploy via Supabase CLI or batch deploy
supabase functions deploy run-model
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend
Push changes to GitHub and deploy to Vercel:
```bash
git push origin main
# Vercel will auto-deploy if connected
```

### 3. Test
1. Create new version with property information
2. Verify fields appear in version list
3. Check detail page shows complete information
4. Confirm metadata doesn't affect calculations

## Benefits

### 1. Centralized Property Information
All property details stored alongside financial models

### 2. Easy Comparison
Compare multiple scenarios with different properties side-by-side

### 3. Partnership Documentation
Track partnership terms and lease conditions

### 4. Location Analysis
Evaluate which locations offer best financial opportunities

### 5. Decision Support
Make informed decisions based on both financial projections and property characteristics

## Data Integrity

- **No Impact on Calculations:** Property metadata is display-only, doesn't affect financial model
- **Optional Fields:** All property fields are optional, not required
- **Existing Versions:** Old versions without metadata continue to work
- **Flexible Format:** Free-text fields allow any units or description format

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for later:
1. **Structured Fields:** Separate fields for city, district, address
2. **Partnership Terms:** Dedicated fields for lease duration, profit split, renewal options
3. **Map Integration:** Display location on map
4. **Document Attachments:** Link lease agreements, floor plans
5. **Comparison View:** Side-by-side property comparison table
6. **Export:** Include property info in model exports

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create version with all property fields filled
- [ ] Create version with some property fields empty
- [ ] Create version with no property fields
- [ ] Verify list view displays correctly
- [ ] Verify detail view displays correctly
- [ ] Verify existing versions still work
- [ ] Confirm financial calculations unchanged
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

**Commit Hash:** 72787e6
**Commit Message:** Add property metadata fields to version management
**Files Changed:** 4 files, 118 insertions, 4 deletions

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check that metadata is being saved (inspect version.metadata in database)
2. Verify edge function deployed successfully
3. Review browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Test with simple property values first

## Conclusion

Property metadata fields provide a simple but powerful way to track and compare location characteristics alongside financial projections. This enhancement supports better decision-making for long-term lease partnerships and site selection.
