# Recurring CAPEX Quick Start Guide

## What Changed

Your assumptions page now has TWO CAPEX sections instead of one:

### 1. Near-term Manual CAPEX (2025-2027) - Orange Border
**Same as before** - for specific projects:
- Add individual CAPEX entries manually
- Set year, amount, depreciation, description
- Use for known near-term investments

### 2. Recurring CAPEX Planning (2028-2052) - Purple Border
**NEW FEATURE** - for automated lifecycle management:
- Configure investment categories
- System auto-generates entries based on recurrence rules
- See live preview of all generated CAPEX

## How to Use Recurring CAPEX

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Click "Add Recurring CAPEX Configuration"**
- New row appears with 7 fields

**Step 2: Configure Your Investment:**
- **Category:** Choose from 5 options (Buildings, FF&E, IT, Transportation, Strategic)
- **Asset Type:** Auto-populated based on category
- **Recurrence:** How often (2, 3, 4, or 5 years)
- **Depreciation:** Accounting period (4, 5, 10, or 15 years)
- **Base Amount:** Investment amount in SAR
- **Starting Year:** When to begin (2028-2032)

**Step 3: View Preview**
- Scroll down to see auto-generated schedule
- Shows all CAPEX entries through 2052

## Smart Defaults

When you select a category, the system auto-fills recommended values:

| Category | Default Recurrence | Default Depreciation |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Buildings & Facilities | 5 years | 15 years |
| FF&E | 5 years | 10 years |
| IT & Digital Learning | 2 years | 4 years |
| Transportation | 4 years | 4 years |
| Strategic/Safety | 5 years | 10 years |

You can override these defaults anytime.

## Preview Table

After configuring, scroll to "Auto-generated CAPEX Schedule":
- **Year:** When investment occurs
- **Description:** Category and asset type
- **Amount:** Investment amount (SAR)
- **Depreciation:** Accounting period

**Summary shows:**
- Total number of entries generated
- Planning period (2028-2052)

## Running the Model

When you click "Run Model":
1. System combines manual CAPEX (2025-2027) + recurring CAPEX (2028-2052)
2. Sends all entries to calculation engine
3. Results include:
   - Balance sheet impact (asset accumulation)
   - Cash flow impact (CAPEX outflows)
   - P&L impact (depreciation expense)

## Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start simple:** Configure 1-2 categories first
2. **Review preview:** Always check generated schedule before running model
3. **Mix both systems:** Use manual for special projects, recurring for standard lifecycle
4. **Realistic amounts:** Base amounts on actual vendor quotes when possible
5. **Adjust as needed:** Reconfigure anytime - preview updates instantly

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I have multiple configurations for the same category?**
A: Yes! Add multiple rows for different asset types or different recurrence cycles.

**Q: What if I need a one-time project in 2035?**
A: Use manual CAPEX for one-time projects. Set year to 2035 directly.

**Q: How do I delete a configuration?**
A: Click the red trash icon on the right side of the configuration row.

**Q: Does changing a configuration update the preview?**
A: Yes, instantly. The preview always reflects current configurations.

**Q: Can I change the base amount for future years?**
A: Currently, base amount stays constant. Future enhancement could add inflation adjustment.

## Deployment Status
