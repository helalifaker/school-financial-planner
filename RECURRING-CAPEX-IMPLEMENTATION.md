# Advanced Recurring CAPEX Planning System - Implementation Complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a sophisticated recurring CAPEX planning system that transforms capital expenditure planning from reactive project-based budgeting to proactive lifecycle management.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dual CAPEX System

**Near-term Manual CAPEX (2025-2027)**
- Maintains existing manual entry functionality
- Project-specific investments
- Fully customizable year, amount, depreciation, and description
- Dynamic add/remove functionality preserved

**Recurring CAPEX Planning (2028-2052)**
- Automated lifecycle management
- Category-based configuration
- Auto-generation based on recurrence rules
- Live preview of generated schedule

### 2. Predefined Categories with Smart Defaults

**Buildings & Facilities**
- Asset Types: Buildings/Leasehold improvements, Infrastructure improvements
- Default Recurrence: 5 years
- Default Depreciation: 15 years

**Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment (FF&E)**
- Asset Types: Furniture & equipment, Specialized equipment
- Default Recurrence: 5 years
- Default Depreciation: 10 years

**IT & Digital Learning**
- Asset Types: Computer equipment, Audio/visual equipment, Software/licensing/intangibles
- Default Recurrence: 2 years
- Default Depreciation: 4 years

**Transportation & Campus Operations**
- Asset Types: Vehicle fleet, Maintenance equipment
- Default Recurrence: 4 years
- Default Depreciation: 4 years

**Strategic, Safety & Sustainability**
- Asset Types: Safety/security systems, Sustainability/green initiatives
- Default Recurrence: 5 years
- Default Depreciation: 10 years

### 3. Configuration Interface

**Each Configuration Entry Includes:**
- Category dropdown (5 predefined options)
- Asset Type dropdown (dynamic based on selected category)
- Recurrence (years): 2, 3, 4, or 5 years
- Depreciation (years): 4, 5, 10, or 15 years
- Base Amount (SAR): Currency formatted input
- Starting Year: 2028-2032

**Smart Defaults:**
- When category changes, recurrence and depreciation auto-update to recommended values
- Asset type automatically updates to first option for selected category

### 4. Auto-generation Logic

**How It Works:**
1. System reads all recurring CAPEX configurations
2. For each configuration, generates entries from starting year through 2052
3. Entries repeat every N years based on recurrence setting
4. Each entry includes category label and asset type in description
5. All generated entries sorted by year

**Example:**
```
Configuration:
- Category: IT & Digital Learning
- Asset Type: Computer equipment
- Recurrence: 2 years
- Starting Year: 2028
- Base Amount: 500,000 SAR

Generated Entries:
2028: 500,000 SAR
2030: 500,000 SAR
2032: 500,000 SAR
... (continues through 2052)
```

### 5. Live Preview Component

**Auto-generated CAPEX Schedule Table:**
- Shows all generated entries in chronological order
- Displays: Year, Description, Amount, Depreciation period
- Scrollable view (max height with overflow)
- Summary statistics at bottom

**Summary Information:**
- Total number of CAPEX entries generated
- Coverage period (2028-2052)

### 6. Financial Model Integration

**Combined CAPEX Array:**
- Merges manual near-term entries with auto-generated recurring entries
- Sorted by year chronologically
- Passed to financial calculation engine
- Affects balance sheet (asset accumulation), cash flow, and P&L (depreciation)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface CapexEntry {
  year: number
  amount: number
  depreciation_period: number
  description: string
}

interface RecurringCAPEXConfig {
  id: string
  category: string
  assetType: string
  recurrenceYears: number
  depreciationYears: number
  baseAmount: number
  startingYear: number
}
```

### State Management

**Manual CAPEX State:**
```typescript
const [capexEntries, setCapexEntries] = useState<CapexEntry[]>([...])
```

**Recurring CAPEX State:**
```typescript
const [recurringCAPEX, setRecurringCAPEX] = useState<RecurringCAPEXConfig[]>([...])
```

### Key Functions

**Add Configuration:**
```typescript
addRecurringCAPEX()
// Creates new configuration with smart defaults
```

**Update Configuration:**
```typescript
updateRecurringCAPEX(id, field, value)
// Updates specific field, auto-updates dependencies
```

**Remove Configuration:**
```typescript
removeRecurringCAPEX(id)
// Removes configuration by ID
```

**Generate CAPEX:**
```typescript
generateRecurringCAPEX(): CapexEntry[]
// Creates all entries based on recurrence rules
```

### Financial Integration

```typescript
// In handleRunModel function
const generatedCAPEX = generateRecurringCAPEX()
const allCAPEX = [...capexEntries, ...generatedCAPEX].sort((a, b) => a.year - b.year)

assumptions.capex_table = allCAPEX
```
