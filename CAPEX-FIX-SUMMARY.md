# Recurring CAPEX Data Structure Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Commit:** 6a41dfd

## Issue Identified

The recurring CAPEX system was implemented with incorrect data relationships due to corrupted OCR extraction. The table structure was mixed up, causing wrong recurrence cycles and depreciation periods to be associated with the wrong asset categories.

## Problem Details

**Corrupted Data (Previous Implementation):**
- Buildings & Facilities: Recurrence 5 years, Depreciation 15 years (INCORRECT)
- FF&E: Recurrence 5 years, Depreciation 10 years (INCORRECT - recurrence was wrong)
- IT & Digital: Recurrence 2 years, Depreciation 4 years (INCORRECT - depreciation was wrong)
- Transportation: Recurrence 4 years, Depreciation 4 years (INCORRECT - depreciation was wrong)
- Strategic/Safety: Recurrence 5 years, Depreciation 10 years (INCORRECT - both wrong)

## Corrected Data Structure

Based on the fixed OCR extraction from `/workspace/OCR-DATA-FIX.md`:

| Category | Asset Type (FAR) | Recurrence | Depreciation |
|----------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| 1. Buildings & Facilities | Buildings/Leasehold improvements | Every 2 years | 10 years |
| 2. Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment (FF&E) | Furniture & Equipment | Every 2 years | 10 years |
| 3. IT & Digital Learning | Computer Equipment/Intangibles | Every 2 years | 2 years |
| 4. Transportation | Vehicles/Equipment | Every 4 years | 2 years |
| 5. Strategic/Safety | Specialized Assets / Intangibles | Every 4 years | 4 years |

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated CAPEX_CATEGORIES Constant

**File:** `app/assumptions/page.tsx` (lines 28-60)

**Key Changes:**
- Buildings & Facilities: 5→2 years recurrence, 15→10 years depreciation
- FF&E: 5→2 years recurrence (depreciation stayed at 10)
- IT & Digital: 4→2 years depreciation (recurrence stayed at 2)
- Transportation: 4→2 years depreciation (recurrence stayed at 4)
- Strategic/Safety: 5→4 years recurrence, 10→4 years depreciation

**Asset Type Updates:**
- Simplified asset type labels to match corrected OCR data
- Removed multiple asset type options per category (single, clearer option per category)
- Updated naming to match standard Financial Accounting Rules (FAR) classifications

### 2. Updated Initial State Values

**File:** `app/assumptions/page.tsx` (lines 129-149)

Fixed the default recurring CAPEX configurations to use corrected values:
- IT Digital example: depreciation 4→2 years, asset type updated
- Buildings example: recurrence 5→2 years, depreciation 15→10 years, asset type updated

### 3. Auto-Update Logic (Unchanged but Verified)

The `updateRecurringCAPEX` function (lines 214-230) correctly propagates changes:
- When a category is selected, it auto-fills correct recurrence and depreciation
- Asset type automatically populated from corrected CAPEX_CATEGORIES
- All defaults now use corrected OCR data

### 4. Generation Logic (Unchanged)

The `generateRecurringCAPEX` function continues to work correctly with the corrected data:
- Generates CAPEX entries based on recurrence cycles
- Applies correct depreciation periods to each entry
- Properly labels entries with corrected asset types

## Impact Assessment

### Backward Compatibility
- BREAKING CHANGE for existing recurring CAPEX configurations
- Users who created versions with the old (incorrect) data will need to review their recurring CAPEX settings
- The system will continue to function, but previously configured recurrence/depreciation values may not match expectations

### User Experience Improvements
- Category labels now numbered (1-5) for clarity
- Asset types simplified to single, clear option per category
- Dropdown selections now show correct lifecycle parameters immediately
- Live preview will display accurate investment schedules

### Financial Model Accuracy
- Depreciation calculations will now use correct periods
- CAPEX timing will follow proper lifecycle management principles
- 25-year projections (2028-2052) will be more realistic

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, verify the following:

### 1. Category Selection
- [ ] Select each of the 5 categories
- [ ] Verify recurrence and depreciation auto-populate correctly
- [ ] Check asset type matches the table above

### 2. Live Preview Generation
- [ ] Configure IT & Digital Learning with 500,000 SAR, starting 2028
- [ ] Verify entries appear in 2028, 2030, 2032... (every 2 years)
- [ ] Check depreciation period is 2 years

- [ ] Configure Transportation with 1,000,000 SAR, starting 2029
- [ ] Verify entries appear in 2029, 2033, 2037... (every 4 years)
- [ ] Check depreciation period is 2 years

### 3. Multiple Categories
- [ ] Add configurations for all 5 categories
- [ ] Verify live preview shows all entries correctly sorted by year
- [ ] Confirm no conflicts or overlapping entries

### 4. Financial Model Integration
- [ ] Create a new version with recurring CAPEX configured
- [ ] Check Balance Sheet PPE calculations reflect correct depreciation
- [ ] Verify Cash Flow investing section shows CAPEX at correct years
