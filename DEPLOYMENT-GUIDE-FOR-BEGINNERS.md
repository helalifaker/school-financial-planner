   - Press Enter

2. **Sign Up**
   - Click "Sign up" (usually a green button)

   - Look for an email from GitHub
   - Click the verification link

**üéâ Congratulations! You now have a GitHub account.**

### Step 2: Install Git on Your Computer (5 minutes)

Git is a tool that helps you send your code to GitHub.

#### For Windows Users:
1. **Download Git**
   - Go to: `git-scm.com/download/win`
