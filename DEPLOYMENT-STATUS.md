# Deployment Status - School Financial Planner

**Date:** November 1, 2025 16:33  
**Status:** ⚠️ PENDING MANUAL DEPLOYMENT

## Summary

All three enhancement tasks have been **successfully implemented and committed** to the local repository:

1. ✅ **French/IB Curriculum Split** - Dual student enrollment and tuition rates
2. ✅ **Recurring CAPEX System** - Automated lifecycle-based capital planning
3. ✅ **Property Metadata Fields** - Land/building size and comments

However, deployment is **blocked by authentication issues** that require manual intervention.

## Blocking Issues

### 1. GitHub Push Authentication ❌

**Problem:**  
```
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address
```

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner

# Configure git to use your GitHub Personal Access Token
git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>@github.com/helalifaker/school-financial-planner.git

# Push all commits
git push origin main
```

**To create a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token and use it in the command above

#### Option B: Switch to SSH
```bash
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:helalifaker/school-financial-planner.git

# Push (requires SSH key configured)
git push origin main
```

#### Option C: Manual Push from Local Machine
```bash
# Clone the repository on your local machine
git clone https://github.com/helalifaker/school-financial-planner.git
cd school-financial-planner

# Download the code changes from the workspace
# (or manually apply the changes from the documentation files)

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Apply French/IB split, recurring CAPEX, and property metadata features"
git push origin main
```

---

### 2. Supabase Edge Function Deployment ❌

**Problem:**  
Current Supabase access token has expired

**What Needs Deployment:**  
`supabase/functions/run-model/index.ts` - Updated to accept and store property metadata

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Deploy via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/unwehmjzzyghaslunkkl
2. Navigate to Edge Functions
3. Find or create the `run-model` function
4. Copy the contents of `/workspace/school-financial-planner/supabase/functions/run-model/index.ts`
5. Paste into the editor and deploy

#### Option B: Deploy via Supabase CLI
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref unwehmjzzyghaslunkkl

# Deploy the function
cd /workspace/school-financial-planner
supabase functions deploy run-model
```

#### Option C: Wait for Token Refresh
The coordinator has been requested to refresh the Supabase access token. Once refreshed, deployment can proceed automatically.

---

## After Successful Deployment

Once both GitHub push and edge function deployment are complete:

### 1. Verify Vercel Deployment
- Vercel should automatically deploy from the main branch
- Check: https://vercel.com/faker-helalis-projects/school-financial-planner
- Wait for build to complete (typically 2-3 minutes)

### 2. Test Live Application

Visit: https://school-financial-planner-rpfb-e4mqm9vr1-faker-helalis-projects.vercel.app

**Test Checklist:**

#### Property Metadata (Version Creation)
- [ ] Create new version with property metadata fields
- [ ] Enter land size (e.g., "5,000 sqm")
- [ ] Enter building size (e.g., "3,500 sqm")
- [ ] Enter comments (e.g., "Prime location near metro")
- [ ] Verify metadata saves successfully

#### French/IB Split (Assumptions Page)
- [ ] Student enrollment shows separate French and IB fields for 2025-2027
- [ ] Tuition shows dual rates (French and IB) with shared growth
- [ ] Growth frequency dropdown shows options 1-5 years
- [ ] Same structure in long-term planning (2028-2052)
- [ ] Verify calculations work correctly

#### Recurring CAPEX System
- [ ] CAPEX section shows manual entries for 2025-2027
- [ ] Recurring CAPEX configuration table appears for long-term
- [ ] Configure a category (e.g., IT/Digital Infrastructure)
- [ ] Verify live preview shows generated entries through 2052
- [ ] Check entries follow recurrence rules (e.g., every 2 years)

#### Version Display
- [ ] Version list page shows property metadata
- [ ] Version detail page shows property information section
- [ ] All financial tabs work correctly (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Assumptions Page
- French and IB student enrollment fields separate
- Dual tuition rates with single shared growth
- Growth frequency: 1-5 years (instead of 1-3)
- Rent model correctly shows conditional fields for "Fixed + Inflation"
- Long-term section mirrors near-term structure

### Recurring CAPEX
- 5 predefined categories with smart defaults
- Configuration table with recurrence and depreciation settings
- Live preview showing all generated entries 2028-2052
- Automatic generation based on lifecycle rules
- Combined with manual CAPEX entries

### Property Metadata
- Land Size, Building Size, Property Comments fields
- Visible in version creation form
- Displayed in version list (truncated comments)
- Full display in version detail overview tab
- Stored in version.metadata JSON field

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment:

```bash
# Revert all commits
git reset --hard 9b834ef

# Force push to GitHub
git push origin main --force

# Redeploy previous edge function version via Supabase dashboard
```

**Previous stable commit:** `9b834ef`

---

## Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment or testing:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for build errors
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Check Supabase edge function logs for backend errors
4. Review the comprehensive documentation files for troubleshooting

All features are backward compatible - existing versions will continue to work without property metadata or with old CAPEX format.

---

**Next Action Required:** Choose a deployment method from the options above and proceed with GitHub push and Supabase edge function deployment.
